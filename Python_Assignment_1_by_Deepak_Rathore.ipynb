    "## Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification or specialisation of data elements is referred to as data types. It represents the kind of value that specifies the operations that can be performed on a given set of data. The following are some types of data types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Numeric Datatype: \n",
    "The data with a numeric value is represented by the numeric data type. Integers, floating numbers, and even complex numbers can be used as numerical values. In Python, these values are represented by the int, float, and complex classes respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers - The int class represents this value. It contains whole numbers that are either positive or negative (without fraction or decimal). There is no limit on how lengthy an integer value can be in Python.For eg: a=10, b=int(30).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Float - The float class represents this value. It's a floating-point representation of a real number. A decimal point is used to specify it. To designate scientific notation, the characters e or E, followed by a positive or negative number, might be inserted.For eg: a=30.4, b=float(3.54).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex Numbers - The complex class represents a complex number. (actual part) + (imaginary portion)j is the formula. For eg. 2+3j.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Sequence Datatype:\n",
    "The ordered collection of similar or dissimilar data kinds is known as a sequence. Multiple values can be stored in an ordered and efficient manner using sequences. Python has a variety of sequence types â€”\n",
    "\n",
    "String - Unicode characters are represented as strings, which are arrays of bytes. A string is made up of one or more characters enclosed in a single, double, or triple quotation. There is no character data type in Python; a character is a one-length string. The str class is used to represent it. For eg: a='hello', b=python code\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "List - In Python, lists are ordered and have a count. A list's elements are indexed in a specific order, with 0 serving as the first index. Each element in the list has its own separate spot in the list, allowing duplication of elements in the list while maintaining the credibility of each member.For eg: [[a],[b],'cde', ['f','g']].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple - Tuple is a list-like collection of Python objects. A tuple is a collection of values that can be of any type and are indexed by integers.\n",
    "Commas are used to separate the values of a tuple. It is more customary to define a tuple by terminating the series of values in parentheses, even if it is not required. For eg: (2,3,4,5,'hello','python')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Dictionary:\n",
    "In Python, a dictionary is an unordered collection of data values, similar to a map, used to store data values. Unlike other Data Types, which only contain a single value as an element, Dictionary holds a key:value pair. The dictionary has a key value to make it more optimal. For eg: {Name: 'Deepak Rathore', Address: 'Delhi'}.\n",

    "# Q4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution:\n",
    "A combination made up of values, variables, and operators is called an expression. A value by itself, as well as a variable, is regarded an expression, hence the following are all lawful expressions (assuming that the variable x has been assigned a value).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 20\n",
    "- x\n",
    "- x + 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions can appear on the right hand side of assignment statements since they produce a value when evaluated. A variable, like a value, is a simple expression in and of itself. Evaluating an expression is not the same as outputting a value, which can be confusing. When the Python shell displays the result of an expression, it follows the same format as when you type a value. In the case of strings, this means that the quotation marks are included. The print statement, on the other hand, publishes the value of the expression, which in this example is the string's contents. All expressions by itself is a legal statement in a script, but it does nothing."
